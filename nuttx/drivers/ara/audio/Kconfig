config DRIVERS_ARA_AUDIO_BOARD
	bool "Audio board support"
	default n
	---help---
		A Greybus Audio Module has at least one Audio Bundle.
		Each Audio Bundle represents an audio codec and has
		exactly one Audio Management CPort and one or more
		Audio Data CPorts.  Each Audio Data CPort corresponds
		to a usable I2S connection on the associated codec.
		An I2S connection is also known as a Digital Audio
		Interface (DAI).

		Audio Bundle information is specified in the module's
		interface manifest but there is no easy way for drivers
		on the module to access that information.  This driver
		provides that information in a relatively easy manner
		and is required for Greybus audio to work.
