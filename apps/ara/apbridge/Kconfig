config APBRIDGEA
	bool "APBridgeA FW"
	select GREYBUS_UTILS
	select USBDEV_DMA
	default n
	---help---
		Enable Firmware for APBridgeA which is the APBridge
		on the AP module.  Do not select this for APBridgeE
		('E' for endpoint) which is the APBridge on anything
		that is not the AP module.  Do not select this for
		GPBridge either.

config APBRIDGEA_LOCAL_RX
    bool "APBridgeA local receiver support"
    depends on APBRIDGEA
    default n
	---help---
        Normally, UniPro messages received by APBridgeA are automatically
        forwarded to the USB/HSIC interface.  Selecting this feature allows
        UniPro messages for individual CPorts to be directed to a local
        receiver on APBridgeA.

	prompt "Select the backend"
config APBRIDGEA_UNIPRO
	bool "Enable bridge mode on APBridgeA"
	depends on APBRIDGEA
	---help---
		The firmware will act as bridge between UniPro and USB.
config APBRIDGEA_DUMMY
	bool "Enable dummy mode on APBridgeA"
	depends on APBRIDGEA
	---help---
		Enable dummy backend on APBridgeA.
		The firmware will just enumerate.
		This backend is only useful to test hardware.
